  title: Nomics API
  version: 1.0.0
  description: |
    Welcome to the Nomics API. Early access is currently underway. If you're interested in
    our API please [contact us](https://p.nomics.com/contact/).

    [nomics.com](https://nomics.com) is built entirely with the Nomics API. Everything
    we've done on [nomics.com](https://nomics.com) you can do with our API. There are
    no internal api endpoints.

    # Errors

    The Nomics API uses standard HTTP status codes to indicate success or failure. 200
    represents success, 4xx represents a user error (such as a problem with your key),
    and 5xx represents a problem with our API.

    # Versioning

    We follow Semantic Versioning. That means our API is versioned as Major.Minor.Patch.
    For example, Version 1.2.3 has major version 1, minor version 2, and patch version 3.
    
    Major version changes indicate that we have altered
    the API significantly and it is no longer compatible with a previous version. Major
    versions are also used as the API url prefix.

    When we update the major version, we will not remove the previous version without notice
    to API customers and a deprecation period to allow everyone to smoothly update to the new
    version.

    Minor version changes indicate that we have added new functionality without breaking
    any existing functionality. An API client is compatible with future minor versions. Note
    that a minor version update may add a new field to an existing API endpoint's response. Your
    API client must ignore fields it does not understand in order to be compatible with future
    minor versions.

    Patch version changes indicate we fixed a bug or security vulnerability. Patch versions
    don't add new functionality.

    # JSON and CSV Support

    By default, all endpoints serve data as JSON. However, by passing `format=csv` in the URL,
    an endpoint will return CSV data. This can be used in Google Sheets via the `IMPORTDATA`
    function.

    CSV responses will not contain a header row, this is so that data can be easily concatenated
    from multiple requests. The fields will be rendered in the same order as the JSON fields. See
    the endpoint's documentation for an example.

    # Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)

    This API supports Cross Origin Resource Sharing, which allows you to make API requests directly
    from your user's browser.

    To use CORS, you must provide Nomics with the domains on which your application will run so that
    we can whitelist them for CORS access.

    Requests from `localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, and `0.0.0.0` will always succeed to aid in development.
